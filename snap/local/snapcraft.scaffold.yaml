# HACK: layout is needed because the built ePSXe snap fails to play games with
# the following error:
# Init core spu ... ALSA lib conf.c:3916:(snd_config_update_r) Cannot access file /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
# ALSA lib pcm.c:2495:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM default
# unable to open pcm device: No such file or directory
# Error: can't open sound handler.
#  * Error can't open sound handler. (try -nosound)
#
# The `-nosound` was tried but there seem to be a bug in ePSXe where the screen
# is black and no game can be played.
# The layout makes playing games with ePSXe possible but sound still doesn't
# work. Needing the layout in the first place may be just a symptom of something
# that makes it hard to make sound works with ePSXe. Unfortunately, ePSXe is
# closed-source and probably has many old internal dependencies (curl3 is one of
# them).
