## Known Issues

1. At the moment, the Snap package is still in its early stages and the most
  notable issue is that sound doesn't work:sweat_smile:. My personal
  recommendation is to just listen to podcasts or something when you're playing
  games:sweat_smile:.

## Related Projects

1. [QJoyPad](https://github.com/panzi/qjoypad): Can be incredibly useful with
  ePSXe as you can map keyboard keys to the joypad. For example, `F1`/`F3` for
  saving/loading states. There's also a
  [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/qjoypad-ahimta) I made for it for easier
  installation.
